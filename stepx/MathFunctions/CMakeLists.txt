# INTERFACE means things that consumers require but the producer doesnâ€™t.
# So if we include the source directory of a library in our project directory,
# we don't need to add the source directory to our project's include path explicitly,
# all we need to do is to link the library and the source directory will be automatically
# added to our project directory.
